# DPNONDP
Code repository for the EMNLP 2024 paper: *Thinking Outside of the Differential Privacy Box: A Case Study in Text Privatization with Language Model Prompting*

## Usage
The `DP.py` file contains the code necessary to run all three versions (DP, Quasi-DP, Non-DP) of `DP-Prompt`, as described in the paper. Please refer to Appendix B of the paper for specific implementation details.

In the `data` directory, you will find the two prepared datasets (**author10** and **topic10**), which we make available to reproduce our experiments as well as to conduct new ones!
